# Dicoding Submission: JavaScript Project

This repository contains my submissions for the JavaScript project as part of the Dicoding course. The project is organized into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of JavaScript development.

## Table of Contents

1. [Writing Comments](#01-writing-comments)
2. [Code Style](#02-code-style)
3. [Writing Tests](#03-writing-test)
4. [Optional: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](#optional-04-oop)
5. [Optional: Recursive Functions](#optional-05-recursive)
6. [Optional: Full Coverage Testing](#optional-06-full-coverage-testing)
7. [Optional: Real World Scenario](#optional-07-real-world-scenario)

## 01 Writing Comments

This section focuses on best practices for writing comments in your code to enhance readability and maintainability. Proper commenting helps other developers (and your future self) understand your thought process and the functionality of your code.

## 02 Code Style

In this section, we discuss the importance of maintaining a consistent code style. Adhering to a specific coding convention can improve the clarity of your code and make collaboration easier. This project follows [specific coding guidelines](https://example.com) (replace with actual guidelines).

## 03 Writing Tests

Testing is a crucial part of the development process. This section covers how to write effective tests to ensure your code behaves as expected. We will explore different testing frameworks and methodologies used in JavaScript.

## Optional: 04 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This optional section delves into the principles of Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript. It covers concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation, providing examples to illustrate each concept.

## Optional: 05 Recursive Functions

In this section, we explore recursive functions in JavaScript. We discuss when and how to use recursion effectively, along with examples and potential pitfalls to avoid.

## Optional: 06 Full Coverage Testing

Full coverage testing is essential to ensure that your code is robust and free of bugs. This section explains how to achieve full coverage in your tests, including strategies and tools available in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Optional: 07 Real World Scenario

In this final optional section, we present a real-world scenario where the concepts discussed in this project can be applied. This includes practical examples that demonstrate the importance of good coding practices and testing in a production environment.
